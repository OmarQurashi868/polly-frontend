# Polly frontend
### https://pollybee.herokuapp.com/

The source code for my Polly project frontend. It uses React to render everything on the page.
This is my first react project, it's just a simple website where you can creating voting polls and share them to get information about what people want.
It was just a random idea i got off the top of my head and since it didn't seem too difficult I decided to use it as my first project. The server is also hosted on Heroku on dev mode for the time being.
